    Most of our bakery items are best kept refridgerated in closed containers, where they will more easily retain moisture. If you find your good to be a little stale,
    crunchy, or uncomfortably cold by the time of consumption, pour a splash of milk onto a plate and set the good on top of it before microwaving for a short period of time.
